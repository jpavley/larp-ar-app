LARP AR Mobile App: Live action role playing augmented reality mobile application and world server. _Woah, that's a lot of buzzwords strung together!_  
WTF is this a joke?  

My idea here is that what the world needs now is a game layer. We have all sorts of layers on top of so called _physical reality_. These layers are sort like games in that they are fictions. But not games in that they are not voluntary. You have to participate. Actually you can cut yourself off from society and choose not to participate but generally you are not allowed to. You'll have to pay taxes or something to some authority. Look, don't listen to me. Watch this video and then comeback when you are done. (It's a TED Talk so you know it's legit.)

OK Did you watch it? Awesome! 

Basically we live in the physical world (or something like it) where the rules, like gravity and evolution and thermodynamics, are hard and fast:

* You need a regular supply of water and food. 
* You need somekind of shelter from the elements. 
* You need somekind of human companionship. 
* You need somekind of intellectual simutation. 
* You develop cognetive abilities over time. 
* You grow old. You die.

Layered on top of the physical world are any number of social obligations. Rules that you have to respect if you want to get along with your family, friends, culture, religion, co-workers, and government. And it's my opinion, backed up by Emanual Kant, that you also have your own personal layer of rules that you use to integrate all these other layers into somekind of workable system, smoothing over contradictions and taking advantage of loopholes.

But that personal layer of integration is exhausting! It's tiring just explaning it all.

What the world needs now is a universal layer of fun.
